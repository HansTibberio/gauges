# RPM Gauge Visualization in Rust

This project implements a visual representation of an RPM gauge using Rust and the Piston graphics library. The gauge features a dynamic needle that responds to user input, simulating the increase and decrease of RPM values. It includes visual indicators for safe and danger zones, providing a clear and intuitive interface for monitoring RPM levels.

## Features

- Dynamic RPM updates based on user input.
- Visual representation of RPM ticks and labels.
- Color-coded danger zone indicators.
- Smooth needle movement and gauge drawing.
- Customizable maximum RPM value and thresholds.


## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Clone the repository and use the following command to run:
